I am free to say this, so please refrain from saying anything like that again. I didn't get banned for trolling, or personal attacks, I got banned because I changed an article to NPOV when the far majority of the editors here would rather the see the BNP article as a diatribe denouncing the party.

0	" A tag has been placed on Jerome leung kam, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable.   If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ""db"" tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.  For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.   "

So tell me how it is that a guy wants to check John Cena's recent activity in the WWE can't because SOME people want to keep the page unedited.

If I want to put what happened at Backlash I WILL BLODDY WELL PUT WHAT HAPPENED AT BACKLASH! Don't any of you nerds try and stop me!   
0	"  == Administrator Complaint Filed Against You ==  I requested that you do not edit the article until the editor assistance has been sought. But you still added and the tag you added is fault because this is a professionally written article, besides the last section there is nothing about the article having a fan flavor to it. Before you add the add again please do show which section besides the ""What Ram's Fan's have to say about him"" seems written from a fan point of view. This article besides the last section adheres to the Wikpedia standard of writing. IF not please first prove it in my notes. As for the resource the technical person on the team is in the process of adding the refernce link to the source after which we will remove that tag as well.   Once again please do not add false tags, lets wait for the editor and the administrator, I did tell the administrator to look at the history and have provided your notes to him. So at this time, just have patience and lets wait.  I am  also forwarding this to the administrator from whom I have requested help. Like I said before, as adminstrator came to the page and made the necessary changes, she did not find the article sub-standard, so please refrain from adding tags.    "

0	  :Hello Cielomobile. I have to say that I also belive that the edits made recently to the United States-Mexico barrier page were not vandalism. I understand that the topic of the border can be polemic, but I don't think that User:68.2.242.165 was vandalizing the page. Maybe you could use the talk page Talk:United States–Mexico barrier to lay out your objections to those edits without deleting them entirely. I think they were good-faith efforts to improve the article, and that is also one of the guiding principles of Wikipedia, to Assume Good Faith. It might help though, if the author of those edits were to register with Wikipedia so the edits won't appear merely with an IP address.  
0	"  == my removal of your content on DNA melting ==  I removed the content you placed when creating the article because it was wrong and unreferenced. Mutations do not have ""weird structures""  a point mutation might start with a single nucleotide mismatch, but those are rapidly detected and repaired to form a stable bonded double-helix structure, and subsequent rounds of DNA replication match each base with its complement. Perhaps your wording was wrong, perhaps you were thinking of an obscure related technology that I have heard of, but you didn't give a reference and I'm not going to help you with this, because you're being rude. I find it disturbing that you apparently made this scientific page on wikipedia claiming a statement of fact that was in merely based on your own speculations.  "

0	"  ::I also found use of the word ""humanists"" confusing.  The types of people listed preceding ""humanists"" are defined by what they *do* (i.e. study, teach, do medical research) which makes sense in the context of talking about the commonplace book as one of their tools.  ""Humanists"" defines people of a certain ethical ideologywhat does that have to do with the function of a commonplace book?  Is the use of a commonplace book particularly defined by one's world perspective?  To me this would be akin to writing ""many blogs are maintained by writers, professors, lawyers, editorialists, and Republicans/Democrats"" in an article about blogs.  True though it may be, it confuses the reader into thinking that the subject being written about is somehow ideologically specific when it is not."

0	"  :Going by immediate place of origin is much more in keeping with the definition of ""Hispanic or Latino"".

As far as spelling goes by Vesa or Projects or whoever, well, if you keep on repeating yourself and have no time, some spelling errors might occur, but it's not the spelling that counts but content which is being vandalised by so called just users and administrators of this so called just wikipedia. And it is obvious wahkeenah has some personal interest in this, proof: All over internet we have Reeves' death explained in detail and possible people involved, but over here he is taking everything down, the idiotic administratotors are reversing it, thus making themselves look stupid and ignorant by not realizing the historical facts."

0	 ==Fixed== Hi, I fixed up the Religion in Vietnam lead with atheism as state religion first as per your request, please take a look. The disparity in the pie chart seems mainly caused by that US institute counting 45% ancestor worship and traditional beliefs as religion, wheras officially that 45% are non-believers.

0	"==  Inclusion of school type, gender, and religious information for HNMCS ==  There have been repeated deletions by Mikeycanuck (aka 99.254.17.230) which remove pertinent information about Holy Name of Mary College School (HNMCS) from this article. The two schools are brother and sister schools, and as per the History section in the HNMCS article, ""The Felician Sisters and St. Michael's College School co-founded the independent Holy Name of Mary College School"". As such, it is appropriate to contain some basic information about HNMCS in this article and in the same way, to include some basic information about SMCS in the Holy Name of Mary College School article. The inclusion of the school type (independent), gender (all-girls), and religious information (Catholic) of Holy Name of Mary College School in this article, is meant to illustrate the parallels to the school type (private), gender (all-boys), and religious information (Catholic) of St. Michael's College School.    I don't agree that it is relevant information to give these details about Holy Name on the SMCS wiki. People reading the SMCS page quickly learn that Holy Name of Mary is the official sister school, and that it must be an all-girls school. That Holy Name is Catholic or private is also irrelavant in the SMCS article. If a reader interested in information on Holy Name wants to learn about it, he/she can go to the Holy Name wiki. I believe it should be removed as not necessary in an article about SMCS (and the same for St. Mike's info on the HNMCS wiki).  — Preceding unsigned comment added by      The point of including this basic information is to show how Holy Name of Mary College School and St. Michael's College School are connected by virtue of their school type, single-gender, and religious affiliation. The inclusion of this basic information is included to illustrate the parallels between the two schools.  These parallels are part of the reason they are brother and sister schools, and therefore this information is relevant and should be included in the article.     They are two separate institutions. If you want to write a paragraph describing the schools' connections, that can be done in sub-article within the main article. Readers can go to the other school's wiki for more detailed information and don't need to see it in the introduction, where it appears as self-serving PR. See Basic Navigation in Wikipedia  ""Wikipedia articles are all linked, or cross-referenced. When highlighted text like this is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information elsewhere. Holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead. The reader is always one click away from more information on any point that has a link attached.""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About    So if understand correctly, the inclusion of a section on each wiki describing the links between the schools is an acceptable compromise in your view?     I only ask Mikeycanuck for clarification because it goes against his reasoning for removing the very basic information previously included in the introduction that drew the parallels between the two schools. In removing that content, Mikeycanuck commented (see View History), ""Removed superfluous information on Holy Name. Should be in HNM's wiki.""  So Mikeycanuck, you are adverse to very basic information included in the introduction, but you would welcome an entire paragraph within the article?  I want to ensure we have reached agreement before I go ahead and add that paragraph.     The detailed information does not belong in the introduction, which should always be concise and relevant. In a later section, a description of the school's links is acceptable, if it is relevant. If SMCS chose Holy Name as its ""sister school"" for certain reasons, and they are verifiable, I would not object. I am never opposed to compromise and reasonable discussion and discourse.     I never
